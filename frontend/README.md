This template offers a simple and efficient starting point for building React applications with Vite. It includes Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and basic ESLint configuration out of the box, helping you develop faster and maintain cleaner code.

🚀 Official React Plugins for Vite

You can select from two official plugins optimized for React:

@vitejs/plugin-react – Utilizes Babel (or oxc with rolldown-vite) to support Fast Refresh.

@vitejs/plugin-react-swc – Uses SWC, delivering even faster performance and improved Fast Refresh.


⚛️ React Compiler

By default, the React Compiler is turned off in this template because it may impact development and build performance.
If you want to enable it, refer to the official React documentation for setup instructions.

📘 Enhancing ESLint

For production-ready applications, it’s recommended to use TypeScript along with type-aware ESLint rules to improve reliability, maintainability, and overall code quality.
