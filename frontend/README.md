This template provides a clean and minimal setup for running React with Vite. It comes pre-configured with Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and basic ESLint rules to help you start building fast and maintainable React applications.

🚀 Available Official Plugins

You can choose from two official Vite plugins tailored for React development:

@vitejs/plugin-react – Uses Babel (or oxc when used with rolldown-vite) to enable Fast Refresh.

@vitejs/plugin-react-swc – Uses SWC for improved performance and a faster Fast Refresh experience.


⚛️ React Compiler

The React Compiler is disabled by default in this template because it can affect development and build performance.
If you wish to enable it, please refer to the official React documentation for the recommended setup and configuration instructions.

📘 Extending ESLint Configuration

If you're building a production-level application, we highly recommend using TypeScript along with type-aware ESLint rules for stronger type safety and improved code quality.
