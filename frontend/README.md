This template provides a clean and efficient foundation for building React applications with Vite. It comes preconfigured with Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and a basic ESLint setup, allowing you to develop quickly while maintaining clean and consistent code.

🚀 Official React Plugins for Vite

You can choose from two optimized plugins for React development:

@vitejs/plugin-react – Powered by Babel (or oxc when paired with rolldown-vite) to enable Fast Refresh.

@vitejs/plugin-react-swc – Uses SWC for enhanced performance and an even faster Fast Refresh experience.


⚛️ React Compiler

The React Compiler is disabled by default because it can affect both development and build performance. If you'd like to enable it, refer to the official React documentation for proper setup and configuration guidance.

📘 Improving ESLint for Production

For production-grade applications, it's recommended to integrate TypeScript along with type-aware ESLint rules. This combination offers stronger type safety, better maintainability, and improved code quality.
